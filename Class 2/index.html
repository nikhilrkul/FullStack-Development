          All battery claims depend on network configuration and many other
          factors; actual results will vary. Battery has limited recharge cycles
          and may eventually need to be replaced. Battery life and charge cycles
          vary by use and settings. See apple.com/in/batteries and
          apple.com/in/iphone/battery.html for more information.
